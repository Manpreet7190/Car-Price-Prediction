# Car-Price-Prediction
In this project, I used a Linear Regression model to predict the selling price of used cars. The model is trained using:

Company: The manufacturer of the car.
Year: The year of manufacture.
Present Price: The current market value of the car.
Kms Driven: The total distance driven by the car (in kilometers).
Fuel Type: Type of fuel used by the car (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, etc.).
Seller Type: Whether the car is sold by an individual or a dealer.
Transmission: The type of transmission (Manual/Automatic).
Owner: The number of previous owners of the car.
